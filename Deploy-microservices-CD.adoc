= Deploying microservices with Pivotal CF using a CI pipeline in Jenkins

== Creating the Jenkins pipeline

* Login to a Jenkins server. 
* Explore the existing projects, their build status and logs.
* Now let's create a new CI pipeline for you. On the left menu, click "New Item".
* Choose "Freestyle Project". Give it the name "microservices-bootcamp-<yourname>". Please use this convention so we can recycle these after the bootcamp.
* On "Github project", enter "https://github.com/bbertka/PCF-demo"
* On source code management, click "GIT" and enter the following repository info:
- Repository URL: https://github.com/bbertka/PCF-demo
- Branch: */micro-services
* On "Build Triggers", select "Build when a change is pushed to GitHub"
* If you have an artifactory server available:  On "Build Environment", select "Maven3-Artifactory Integration". Select your Artifactory Server. Click "Refresh Repositories" and select the following repositories: "ext-release-local" for releases and "ext-snapshot-local" for snapshots. Also select "Capture and publish build info". When demo'ing,  *don't* select "Deploy artifacts to Artifactory", as it would require additional storage space per deploy.
* On "Build", setup as following:
- Invoke Maven 3:  Root pom "PCFDemo-map/pom.xml", goal "clean package"
- Click 'Advanced', and add to MAVEN_OPTS (may vary for your environment): -Dmaven.multiModuleProjectDirectory=/var/vcap/packages/maven
- Execute Shell:

* If you'd like to add any additional steps (like smoke tests) to the build, add as a "Post Build Action".
* Save changes.
* Detail your new project. On the menu, click "Build now". 
* As a new build starts, detail it and click on "Console Output" to see the build / deploy real-time logging info.
* Do any troubleshoot needed until you have a clean build.
* Congratulations! You have created your CI pipeline. 

== Demo

* Clean-up your environment on Pivotal CF, to have an empty space to demo.
* Login to Jenkins
* Click on your project to detail
* Click "build now". 
* Check "Console output" as jenkins downloads the source code and deploys it to Pivotal CF.
* Navigate back to Pivotal CF Web Console and show service created and app deployed. 
* Demo the app
